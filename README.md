My research and attempt for character rendering, including hair„ÄÅeyes and face in unity URP.(Won't upload any resources, only share shaders and ideas).

## Hair

Due to the hair is rendered as transparent material, I use two layer materials, one rendered as opaque object, the other rendered as normal transparent hair.

And in order to solve the transparent sorting problem, I used Weighted Blended OIT method, but I found just ask the artist to merge the hair layers to just one model, can easily solve this question.

Another problem is the opaque layer will cause jaggies, so I use TAA to solve this.
